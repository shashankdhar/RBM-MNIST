# RBM-MNIST

A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic artificial neural network that can learn a probability distribution over its set of inputs.

RBMs have found applications in dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, collaborative filtering, feature learning and topic modeling.

While RBMs are occasionally used, most practitioners in the machine-learning community have deprecated them in favor of generative adversarial networks or variational autoencoders.

The aim of this project was to learn how RBMs reconstructed data by themselves in an unsupervised fashion making several forward and backward passes between the visible layers and hidden layers.

This project was part of my coursework as a graduate student.
